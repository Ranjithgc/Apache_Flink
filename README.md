A very similar example to word count, but different source/sinks. The input data in this case is read off of disk, and the output is written as a csv. The file is generated dynamically at run time.

step 1: create input file
Creating a file containing thousands words which are randomly chosen from a list of predefined hashtags.

step 2: creating a source
Getting the input's from the created file using connect() function which basically assigns the file as a source for the further operations.

step 3: creating sink
It is the output file where the output get's written in csv format

step 4:map function
Doing group by on the hashtags name and then the count funtion basically generates the total count.
